# Algorithm Analysis Tool

This tool analyzes and visualizes the time and space complexity of different sorting algorithms.

## Features

- Implementation of Bubble Sort and Selection Sort algorithms
- Time complexity analysis
- Space complexity analysis
- Visualization using matplotlib

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Usage

Run the script using:

```bash
python algorithm_analysis.py
```

This will generate two plots:
1. Time Complexity Analysis - showing how execution time grows with input size
2. Space Complexity Analysis - showing how memory usage grows with input size

## Understanding the Graphs

- The x-axis represents the input size (n)
- For time complexity: y-axis shows execution time in seconds
- For space complexity: y-axis shows memory usage in KB
